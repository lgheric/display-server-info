= PS =

I have worked for 10+ based on lamp/lnmp architecture, but I have never contributed any plug-ins to wordpress because I'm not very familiar with wordpress.
When I lost my job, I thought of wordpress. I saw that many companies and individuals developed many plug-ins for wordpress, and they were very popular with everyone. I want to look up to them.
When I really wanted to develop a plug-in for wordpress, I was confused. I don't know what plug-in to develop, what the process was, I don't even know what functions wordpress has and how to use it. It's funny, right?
Until one day I accidentally searched for Display PHP Version developed by David Gwyer, and I thought it was time for me to get started.
So I developed Display Server Info, a plug-in as simple as Display PHP Version.

This is my first plug-in. Welcome to leave your valuable comments in wordpress community. Thank you very much!
I would like to express my gratitude to David Gwyer for giving me a hint and guiding me to get started.

I am 45 years old this year, and I have decided to use the rest of my life to develop more simple and useful wordpress plug-ins.
Will you support a novice developer like me?
